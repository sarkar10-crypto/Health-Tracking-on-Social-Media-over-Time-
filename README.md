# Health tracking on social media over Time


# In the project using tools like the Ailment Topic Aspect Model (ATAM) to look at social media posts, especially on platforms like Twitter, to understand how people are feeling health-wise. Tweets give us quick and free access to information about people's health. This helps us see health trends as they happen, which is useful for things like planning health campaigns or spotting risky behaviors early. We're focusing on two main tasks: detecting when people's health changes over time and predicting those changes before they happen. We've come up with a new model called TM-ATAM that's really good at spotting issues in health topics discussed in tweets over time. It's kind of like a special tool that watches how conversations about health change from one tweet to the next. Another model called T-ATAM helps us predict what health changes might happen next based on the patterns it sees in tweets. It's like having a crystal ball for health trends. M-ATAM is better at spotting health changes compared to another method, Lastly, we compared our predictions with data from sources like the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and Google Flu Trends to see how well our models match up with what's officially reported.
